# esp32_bare_metal_4_lane_street_intersection
A simulation of car traffic at a four-lane street intersection equipped with traffic lights is conducted using an 8x8 LED matrix to represent traffic flow, while an RGB LED module displays the traffic lights. All components are integrated with an ESP32 WROVER microcontroller, and cars are randomly generated across the four lanes.

Components:
1x ESP32 WROVER
2x 74HC595 IC to convert serial data into parallel data
8x Resistor 220Î©
1x Freenove 8 RGB LED Module
1x Breadboard
Some jumper wires
